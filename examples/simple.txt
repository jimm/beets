# This is a sample Beets file that plays one four bar pattern a few times.
# It's a text file. Comments start with '#' and can appear anywhere on a
# line. Comments and blank lines are ignored.

# See the README for details.

# Patterns can have any name you want. Any text after "pattern:"
# becomes the pattern name. Any text between here and the next "pattern:"
# belongs to this pattern.
pattern: 1

# Instruments: each instrument in a pattern has its own section. It starts
# with the name of the instrument and continues until the next instrument
# starts, the next pattern starts, or the song starts. Only the first letter
# of drum note names are used, so "bass drum" is the same as "b" and the
# same as "banana".

# Only 'x' and '.' are used. Other characters like newlines, spaces between
# beats, and '|' characters between bars are ignored.
#
# NOTE: some day Beets might introduce some shortcuts that help write
# repeated patterns.
